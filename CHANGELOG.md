# Changelog

Use this file for release notes and the rolling list of changes that have not
been cut into a release yet.

## Unreleased

- Added `microagent init <name>` to scaffold a starter agent body project — a
  `microagent.yaml` spec, a provider-specific `body.py` (Anthropic, OpenAI, or
  Gemini via `--provider`), the shared `protocol.py`, and a runnable demo
  request. Fails closed on existing files unless `--force`. Backed by the new
  `pkg/scaffold` package.
- Refreshed README, install, architecture, boundaries, library, and MCP docs for
  the stable `v0.1.45` release, `microagent-rc` Homebrew formula, and current
  AX/MCP substrate boundary.

## v0.1.45 - 2026-06-01

- Added AX output mode for agent-facing structured CLI responses and errors.
- Added the `microagent serve mcp` stdio endpoint with workspace lifecycle,
  status, inspect, exec, cost-estimate, mutation-preview, idempotency, and
  capability-manifest tools.
- Added the structured exec protocol, guest service, host client, CLI command,
  and MCP wiring.
- Added runtime readiness signals for guest, shell, structured exec, result,
  and mediation state.
- Added mediation target readiness probing for running workspaces, with
  fail-closed errors for required mediation and non-error not-ready status for
  optional mediation.
- Added bounded retry handling for transient MCP structured-exec connection
  failures, including retryable error metadata and retry-exhaustion details.
- Added fast status/inspect readiness behavior for non-live workspace states.
- Expanded Linux/Firecracker E2E coverage for lifecycle, networking,
  mediation/transport, supervision, public CLI surface, and runtime contracts.
- Renamed the project, Go module, Homebrew formula references, and docs from
  `microagent-kit` to `microagent`; the CLI name and `~/.microagent` state
  layout are unchanged.
- Hardened workspace/rootfs security behavior from the May 2026 findings pass.
- Added Apple VF end-to-end mediation validation for guest-to-host vsock,
  host replies, and structured guest results.
- Fixed Apple VF mediation listener setup and transient socket copy handling.
- Added Linux Firecracker validation fixes for NAT and host firewall behavior.
- Project governance, contribution, conduct, and security guidance.
- CI coverage for Linux Go checks, documentation links, shell scripts, and dependency vulnerability scanning.
